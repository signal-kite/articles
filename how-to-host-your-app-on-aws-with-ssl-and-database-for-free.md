# How to host your database with SSL and database for free for at least one year

## Why AWS
Amazon Web Service is a powerful platform that allows doing a lot of things. Literally speaking, you can do everything beginning with simple things like hosting and ending with super-complex machine learning modelling. Moreover, most of their services have:
- free trials
- 12 month free tier
- forever free offers
The full list of services with their free options can be found [here](https://aws.amazon.com/free/).

Unfortunately, there are flaws too: 
- To use many of services and get most of them you need to be proficient in the service's topics
- many services have confusing UI/UX and a million of options
- some of options can easily turn a free service into a crazy-cost one.

Then, why wouldn't use an AWS to host the app, connect to your domain name, provide SSL, alongside with a relational database?
