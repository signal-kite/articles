# 25 things to check when preparing a landing page for a launch

Before you launch your landing page, take time to check all these things. Some of them look pretty minor and unsignificant but can impact the effect your LP will have and it's not only about amount your visitors. The landing page should:

- have nice, catchy design and graphics
- have clear, catchy text
- make people do something (so called CTA, or call to action)
- make people bookmark the website (to come to it later if they are not interested in it now)
- be good for search systems (SEO).

We split all these things to check into groups by topic but keep in mind, some of them can be part of other group.

## 1. Design

### 1. Graphics
Do not use free graphics like Undraw or Absurd illustrations. Not only they are very overused (what makes your website looking as thousands of others) but they are often misleading, distracting, and taste-less. 
Don not use free photos you can find on Unsplash. This is a very good resource but many photos have already been used thousand times what again, makes your website look amateurish.
