Before you launch your landing page, take time to check all these things. Some of them look pretty minor and unsignificant but can impact the effect your LP will have and it's not only about amount your visitors. The landing page should:

- have nice, catchy design and graphics
- have clear, catchy text
- make people do something (so called CTA, or call to action)
- make people bookmark the website (to come to it later if they are not interested in it now)
- be good for search systems (SEO).

We split all these things to check into groups by topic but keep in mind, some of them can be part of other group.

## 1. Design

### 1. Graphics
Do not use free graphics like Undraw or Absurd illustrations. Not only they are very overused (what makes your website looking as thousands of others) but they are often misleading, distracting, and taste-less. 

Be careful with free photos you can find on Unsplash. This is a very good resource but many photos have already been used thousand times what again, makes your website look amateurish.

You can hire a freelance photographer or illustrator, for example here: [https://www.freelancer.com/](https://www.freelancer.com/). We found this resource pretty affordable and the results satisfying.

Another source of great free illustrations (that are actually not free) is [Adobe Stock](https://stock.adobe.com/). The trick is to use their free trial that allows you to download 10 free resources. Be careful though, not all of them are great (for example, we found "seamless patterns" not seamless at all).

A couple of other sources of free graphics:

- [LapaNinja free illustrations](https://www.lapa.ninja/freebies/illustrations/)
- [Storyset](https://storyset.com/).

### 2. Colors
There pretty common principles from the leading designers that will help you with coloring even if you (like us) are not designer al all:

- do not use very contrast colors together (like yellow and green, red and blue, and so on)
- do not use low contrast colors together (like light grey on light black)

#### 2.1. How to choose a palette
When selecting a palette, pick up 1 (max 2) main colors, and 1 or 2 additional (usually they are white or grey). But if you picked 2 main colors, use one as main (for background or big elements) and the second one - for small elements (underlining, small dots, or the first capital letters.

To find the colors that will go toghether well, use the color wheel. It can be found, for example, here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_wheel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_wheel).

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125164513/221445007-414f91ac-548e-4bd7-b1b2-3d5dc10aff9d.png" width="300"/>

The idea is very simple: pick up 2 colors that are on the opposite sides of wheels and you will be good. For example:

- aqua and yellow
- violet and green
- light blue and orange.

Of course, it's not necessarily to follow strict colors, but the tints could be selected in the same way.

### 3. Main design
If you are not a designer or don't want to hire a designer (or you can't) there is only one way to make a nice design: find a website you like and _borrow_ their idea. "Borrow" doesn't mean blatant copying, not at all. It means you may reproduce their findings at your design, but nothing more. Do not copy colors, CSS, texts.

2 great sources of inspirations: [Lapa Ninja](https://www.lapa.ninja) and [Landingfolio](https://www.landingfolio.com/).

#### 4. Logo
If it's your first project it's totally fine to have a simple, homemade logo. Some ideas on how to create it:

- hire a freelancer on [Freelancer](https://www.freelancer.com/)
- use combination of letters
- use icons
- ask [Midjourney](https://www.midjourney.com/) to generate it.

#### 5. Small elements
Icons, dots, arrows can give your website interesting, fresh look. But do not overuse them. Instead of icons, you also can use emojii. But it's a bit tricky: because they are just text symbols, they don't look appealing if using as a text. Instead, consider using the colorful version of them. Google fonts has an open-source [colorful Emoji font](https://fonts.google.com/noto/specimen/Noto+Color+Emoji).

We found these free icon sets the best choice:

- [Tabler Icons](https://tabler-icons.io/) - 3400 icons
- [FontAwesome](https://fontawesome.com/) - 2020 icons.

Also frameworks, like [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/) - 1800 icons have their own icon sets.

#### 6. Background
Can be anything: an image, pattern, or just a color. Just remember that it should not distract the user's attention. 

#### 7. Fonts
The main designers' rule is: no more than 2 different font families and no more than 4 different styles totally.
You can find free and easy-to-use fonts at [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/).

#### 8. Using frameworks
Frameworks are great but don't forget to change the design. We saw so many similar-looking websites that would look great if they would be different.
Frameworks not only help make the website development easier and fater but also help with responsiveness.
Some popular frameworks:

- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)
- [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)
- [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)

The big list of great frameworks can be found here: [https://github.com/troxler/awesome-css-frameworks](https://github.com/troxler/awesome-css-frameworks)

#### 9. Responsiveness
Nowadays, the mobile devices are used for browsing the Internet. So, the responsiveness is crucially important for websites.
Usually, it can be done with [media queries](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Media_Queries/Using_media_queries) but web frameworks already solved this problem for you so you don't need to (see the list in the previous point). 

The modern browsers allow checking your website on small screens, for example, how it can be done on Chrome:

![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125164513/221448904-c282dcd5-a6b0-4e17-8632-aa2f70dfc99e.png)

**Do not forget to check all the elements like buttons, links, menues.**

#### 10. Favicon
Many experts think you can launch without a favicon. Sure, you can but trust us, a website without a favicon looks so amateurish that it can affect the results of launch.
##### Q&A
##### What is a favicon?
It's a small picture shown on the browser's tab:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125164513/223312093-6d222b15-3f17-4449-bd48-85da8c40d3c6.png)

##### What size is that?
It should be 16x16.

##### Which extension is the file?
Actually, it can be anything: .ico, .png, .jpg and so on but for best compatibility use .ico.

##### How to make it?
Usually it's a smaller copy of your logo. Create a square logo and resize it into your favorite editor. Then save it as .ico. If your editor can't save a graphical file as .ico, use any online tool, for example, this free popular tool [CloudConvert](https://cloudconvert.com/png-to-ico).

##### Where to put it?
You can put it anywhere in your website but for the best results, copy it into the root folder. The file should be called favicon.ico.

##### How to insert it?
In your HTML file add the following code (inside the "&lt;head&gt;" tag):
```
<link rel="icon" type="image/x-icon" href="/favicon.ico" />
```
## 2. Content

#### 11. Hero section
There are many articles explaining what to put there but we like [this comprehensive guide by Julian Shapiro](https://www.julian.com/guide/startup/landing-pages).
Shortly speaking, the header should describe what your product does and the subheader should give the idea on how.

_Tip: Use ChatGPT to proofread and even generate good hero texts!_

#### 12. CTA
CTA or "call-to-action" is a button or link prompting a user do something right now. For example, it may be a link to the registration page, or a form to leave their email (we discuss this form in the Functionality section). It's a good idea to put several buttons or forms on the page but do not overuse it.

#### 13. Features? No. Profits!
We see so many landing pages that are focused on their features that we often loose the whole purpose of the service or tool. Instead, it's always better to explain how your product makes the users' lives easier. Which does it solve? how effectively? faster? 
To make the message clear you need to understand which users you are targeted to and solve _their_ problems. Always ask "why" until you gain the core problem to be solved.

##### The example
A web tool helps with memorizing words in a foreign language. One of the features they described was "easy-to-use innovative flash cards" what said nothing to us. Do we really need an "innovative" flash cards? How does it help? We started asking "why" and it turned out that "innovative" flash cards help to memorize words faster therefore founders need to mention it (and they can get rid off the "innovative" word :).

#### Stories are underrated
Althought every single marketing book says the stories are very important, people for some reason don't use them as they could. So, one or two user stories would be great (especially if you don't have any other proves or testimonials).

#### Objections
It's a good idea to find the popular objections and give the answers. You can put them in the FAQ section. The popular objections are:

- Why is your product better than X?
- Why is your product cheaper/more expensive than X?
- Your product looks too complicated/simple
- How can your product help me?
- What are preferenses using your product over using X?

#### Pictures/screenshots
It's a good idea to show the real screenshots instead of abstract pictures showing people doing something on a giant screen... that could look nice but it will not give a potential user an idea about the real product. If you don't have a product yes, show sketches or drawn prototype. For prototyping you can use many free products, for example:

- [JustInMind](https://www.justinmind.com/)
- [MockFlow](https://www.mockflow.com/)
- [Protopie](https://www.protopie.io/)


#### Grammar
Don't forget to check the texts on your website before lauch. Here is how you can do it:

- hire a professional editor
- use [Grammarly](https://www.grammarly.com/) - their free plan is very comprehensive
- ask [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/auth/login) proofread your text

## 3. SEO and social media

#### Meta tags
When you launch your website, even if it's just one page and very simple, it's important to make it discoverable by search engines as soon as possible. Meta tags are special tags that usually are added to the &lt;head&gt; section of a web page. Provide the following tags and make sure they have the correct information:

```
<meta name="description" content="Description of the page">
<meta name="keywords" content="Keywords that will help to find your website">
<meta name="author" content="The company or author name">
```

#### Tags for social networks
When you publish the link on Twitter, Facebook, and other media, the link will be rendered. For example, this is how our link is rendered when mentioned in a tweet:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125164513/224803628-7daafaf7-bc06-406c-ace5-b2c0ef426fa4.png)

##### Twitter
There is no secret: you just need to provide special metatags and the preview image. Twitter calls such a preview "a card" and it's described in [their documentation](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/twitter-for-websites/cards/guides/getting-started). Basically, you need to add the following metatags to your website &lt;head&gt; section:

```
<meta name="twitter:card"              content="summary_large_image">
<meta name="twitter:site"              content="@YourTwitterHandle">


<meta property="og:url"                content="FullPageURL" />
<meta property="og:title"              content="PageTitle" />
<meta property="og:description"        content="PageDescription" />
<meta property="og:image"              content="PreviewPageURL" />
```

A couple of important notes:

1. The preview page URL should be full - so no relative paths like "/images/mypreview.png" would work.
2. To make sure the preview is rendered properly use some Twitter validation tool. Twitter itself has a preview tool but since 2022 the rendering the preview images functionality was removed (nobody knows why) so, instead use free third-party tools, for example, [Tweetpick validator](https://tweetpik.com/twitter-card-validator).

##### Facebook
To be able to render the link preview when posting on Facebook, you use the same OpenGraph (og) metatags and also you need to create a FB application.
This is how to do that:

1. Open the [Facebook page for developers](https://developers.facebook.com/apps/) and click the Create app button.
2. Select Business app type and click the Next button: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125164513/224818759-f599e033-583a-4fa0-84c1-f0d02f1427d7.png)
3. Enter your app name and email, leave the latest option unselected: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125164513/224819109-584514e2-c88f-40c1-a067-27adbd4b8e91.png)
4. You will be redirected to the application page. In the left menu, select Settings --> Basic then copy App ID:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125164513/224819774-22d34482-47cb-4286-9630-5a52cd262f92.png)
5. In the &lt;head&gt; section of a web page insert the following metatag:
```
<meta property="fb:app_id" content="YourAppId">
```
6. To make sure it's working, use [the Facebook debugger](https://developers.facebook.com/tools/debug).
Enter your full URL in the field and click the Debug button.
If you see some strange message like you need to provide "fb:app_id" click the Scrape Again button, you should see something like that:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125164513/224822453-b1e9bad2-ebcc-45ae-ac74-ef348670c7ef.png



## 4. Functionality

#### Website performance and issue monitoring
Sometimes, founders are so focused on decorating the website with nice graphics that they forget the performance may suffer. As a result, the users will not be patient and can leave your website before all the resources load. Here what you can do:

1. Check the website's graphics and optimize heavy pictures. It can be done in old good Photoshop or using an online service, for example, [TinyPNG](https://tinypng.com/). _Keep in mind, JPG pictures are better for photos whereas PNG are more suitable for images with simple graphics and text._ JPG pictures don't support the transparency.
2. Use some monitoring tool showing load or even non-working resources. We found our own tool [SignalKite](https://signalkite.com) the best choice: it's free, simple to install and use, and simple but powerful possibilities for analyzing events and errors. _Remember the performance at your users' computers may differ from what you see at yours!_


#### Email form
Always prompt a user to do something. If you have only a landing and no product yet, you usually wants them to leave their email. You can program it on your own (if you can code, it's a pretty easy task - for example, you can add a simple server code that just sends you email with the user's email) or use a third-party service. We tried several and our latest choice is [Sender](https://www.sender.net/). Their pricing is nice and their support is great and fast (if you really need it).

#### Survey
Another popular form of validation the idea or collecting opinions are surveys. The simple, effective and free tool is Google Forms.
##### Some tips
1. But don't overuse it! Do not ask too many questions and don't ask personal questions (like phone number and name) if you really don't need them.
2. If you collect email/name don't make these fields mandatory.

## 4. All the minor things that are worth to check
##### Broken links
Check all the links you have on your page (they can be found everywhere but I often see then in the footer). Sometimes founders would like to add stubs leading to the same page (like links "About" or "How it works") but I wouldn't do that - it makes the website less truthful.

##### Page title
When people hover the tab of their browser with a mouse, they will see something like that:
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/125164513/224825757-57731b17-495c-43d5-89c7-06355237b335.png)
To provide this additional text, just add a &lt;title&gt; tag to your head section:
```
<title>Signal Kite - Simple Monitoring Tool For Your Website</title>
```
